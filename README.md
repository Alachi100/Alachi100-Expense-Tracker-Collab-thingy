Challenges & Solutions:
Challenges that we had included how to manage data smoothly in cases of adding, deleting, and filtering of expenses. To resolve this challenge, we structured our code to handle input validation and kept stored expenses in a consistent format. Debugging and testing various scenarios also refined the functionality of our program.

The other challenge we faced was managing to distribute tasks efficiently. This we overcame by distributing tasks according to one's strengths and communicating regularly with each other. 

Group Coding Experience:
This collaborative coding experience was really enjoyable for us as a group because we were able to divide the work efficiently and learn each other's ways of problem-solving. However, there were some instances when merging different coding styles and logic was a bit tricky; it took extra effort to maintain consistency. Nevertheless, working together improved our teamwork and debugging skills.
